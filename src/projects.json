    "description": "I have long wanted to recreate the game Compatibility for the web because I love that game, and I thought there were ways to make it even more fun. Without the limitations of a physical board, you could see not only whether you were compatible with your partner, but you could see how much everyone has in common with everyone else. On top of that, we could play around with creating whatever categories and decks that you want.\n\nI also decided I wanted to make this work like a Jackbox game. I had already done something like this with List List Ear, but I wasn't quite as satisfied with how that turned out. It got too buggy, and I never took the time to refactor it. It also didn't have a deck of cards with images, so I don't think it was as fun because of that.\n\nOne of the things I am most proud of with this game is how intuitive and smooth the actual swiping of the cards works. I spent quite a long time perfecting that so that it works on a phone, and I'm happy that with a bunch of friends and family playing it, that part worked well.\n\nI also decided I would heavily use AI for this game, so it helped me with quite a bit of the code. That was fun, and it also helped me to better understand the current limitations and sweet spots of the current batch of LLMs. I tried Chat GPT, Gemini, and Claude. In the end, I stuck with Chat GPT.",

One of the challenging parts that I had not considered when I first thought of the challenge was the actual creation of the words themselves to choose from so that there would always be at least one pangram.\n\nI went a bit overboard with this one and decided to make it look as close to the original as possible just for fun. Then I added the other parts of the game where you can see the rankings and the current words you chose.\n\nFinally, I decided to use local storage to keep track of the specific puzzle you were solving in case you wanted to share it.",

It is about how a three-body system is unstable and cannot be \"solved\". Frankly, I still don't really understand what that all means, but I decided this would be the perfect excuse to create a little space gravity simulation.\n\nOne fun thing with this project is it made me think about the project my dad made with orbiting bodies when I was a kid. It was actually one of the things that really made me think that programming could be creative and fun.\n\nAs with all of my projects, this was done in 2D, but I think it gets the point across. I had a lot of fun playing around with the randomly created bodies and seeing how they interacted with each other. I then created replicas of our Earth and moon, and then my favorite thing was creating a model of a solar system forming where the bodies crash into each other to create larger objects until you are left with a sun and a handful of planets.\n\nI am well aware that this is a super primitive model that likely has many issues, but I still think it gets the point across and it's fun to watch.",

This was before React Native was a thing, so for a web developer, this was the best approach, and using AngularJS with Ionic made it a lot easier. There were a couple of really difficult moments while making this.\n\nThe first was the recursive function I wanted to create that generated all of the various Set decks. For whatever reason, I just could not break it down in my head and figure it out. I almost gave up on it and was going to manually create them separately. It wouldn't have even been that big a deal, but it bothered me knowing there was a better approach, and I couldn't do it. I remember using paper and pencil in a notebook to help me reason around it, and I finally figured it out. I'm sure this would have been no problem for someone more experienced than me with algorithms, but I remember being proud of myself when I figured it out.\n\nThe second was just dealing with the iOS and Android ecosystems for developing, bundling, and deploying these things out to the stores. What a pain in the butt. That was just challenging in being annoying and not clear, but I pushed my way through it.\n\nMy goal going into this was that at least one person downloaded this game that I didn't personally know. In the end, I don't even recall how many people downloaded it (it was free), but I was pleased when I got a cease and desist from the makers of Set. Somehow it got to them, and then I had to take it down.",
